CHViewCodable is designed to be used with any iOS Projects based on View-Code

- ✅ LayoutDimension

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

- This code is heavily inspired from https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit and some internal tools used in my past jobs.

## Installing
Make sure Xcode is installed first and then add this SPM via git url inside Xcode, just like any other Package.

**Use as dependency**

Add the following to your Package.swift file's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/carloshmartins/CHViewCodable", from: "0.3.0"),
```

And then import wherever needed: `import CHViewCodable`

Feel free to add your own!
